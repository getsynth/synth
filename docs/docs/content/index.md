* [null](null) generates as many nulls as you ever want
* [bool](bool) generates `true` or `false`, either constant or
following a given percentage
* [number](number) generates ranges, distributions or series of
[integer or floating-point](number#subtype) numbers
* [series](series) generates streams of events (e.g. for logs)
  * [incrementing](series#incrementing) emits evenly spaced events
  * [poisson](series#poisson) models a random poisson process
  * [cyclical](series#cyclical) models periodic events
  * [zip](series#zip) combines multiple series together
* [string](string) can contain one of the following generators for
various classes of string:
  * [pattern](string#pattern) takes a regular expression and
  generates matching strings
  * [uuid](string#uuid) generates hyphenated UUIDs
  optionally with time zone
  * [faker](string#faker) has a large number of generators for names,
  contact information, credit card numbers, sentences, and much more
  * [format](string#format) combines multiple generators to one
  formatted string
  * [serialized](string#serialized) JSONifies the value of the
  contained generator
  * [truncated](string#truncated) ensures all generated strings stay
  within length limits
  * [categorical](string#categorical) is like a
  [one_of](one-of) specialized for strings
* [date_time](date-time) generates dates and times
* [object](object) creates an object with string keys containing
generators for the values

the contained generator

## Modifiers

[Modifiers](modifiers) encode additional constraints or variations of the generator(s) they apply to.

* [optional](modifiers#optional) makes a value nullable
* [unique](modifiers#unique) ensures the generated values don't contain
  duplicates
* [one_of](one-of) allows you to choose from a set of contained
  generators
* [same_as](same-as) creates a reference to another field in this or
  another collection
