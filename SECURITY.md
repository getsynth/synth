# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

For now, only the latest released version will receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Even though synth is a command line tool without special privileges and
usually won't touch sensitive data (unless perhaps for import), we take our
users' security seriously.

If you found a vulnerability, please send an email to security@getsynth.com.
Please include the synth version, operating system and CPU architecture you
use as well as the steps to exploit.

We will try to get back to you in a timely manner, at least within a week.
This should include either a due date for a fix or a rejection should we not
agree that what was reported is in fact a vulnerability.

Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will file for a CVE in cooperation with
the reporter.
